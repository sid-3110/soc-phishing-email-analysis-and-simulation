## Objective
To identify user behavior patterns and social engineering techniques observed during the phishing simulation and highlight key awareness gaps.

---

## Observed Phishing Techniques

### Use of Authority
The email impersonated a recruitment or HR function, leveraging perceived authority to gain user trust.

### Use of Urgency
The message requested immediate action, reducing the likelihood of careful inspection by the recipient.

### Generic Messaging
Lack of personalization allowed the same message to be reused across multiple targets.

## User Interaction Findings
- The email was opened successfully
- The embedded link was clicked
- The landing page was accessed without prior verification of sender authenticity

---

## Awareness Gaps Identified
- Users may prioritize urgency over verification
- Email authentication indicators are not visible to end users
- Job-related lures are effective against a wide audience

---

## SOC Insight
Phishing success is often driven more by psychology than technical sophistication. Awareness training must focus on behavioral indicators, not just technical warnings.
