# Phishing Email Detection & Simulation 

## Overview
This project demonstrates a SOC Level 1 approach to phishing email detection, analysis, and awareness-based simulation. The focus is on understanding attacker techniques, user behavior, and SOC decision-making rather than credential harvesting or exploitation.

## Objectives
- Simulate a realistic phishing email in a controlled lab environment
- Analyze email content and headers (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Perform SOC-style investigation and classification
- Document true positive, false positive, and gray-area cases
- Provide awareness and prevention recommendations

## Tools Used
- GoPhish (Phishing Simulation)
- MailHog (Local SMTP testing)
- Email Header Analysis tools
- Whois / Domain reputation checks

## Key SOC Skills Demonstrated
- Phishing detection and analysis
- Email authentication evaluation
- Alert triage and investigation
- Documentation and escalation logic
- Security awareness mindset

## Ethical Note
All simulations were conducted in a controlled lab environment using test email accounts. No real credentials were captured or transmitted.
