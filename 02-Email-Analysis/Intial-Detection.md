A job application status email was reported for analysis. The message claimed that the recipient had been shortlisted and requested immediate action to proceed further.

## Reason for Review
The email was flagged due to the following indicators:
- Unexpected job-related communication
- Urgent call-to-action prompting quick response
- Generic greeting without personalization
- No prior communication history with the sender

## SOC Initial Assessment
At this stage, the email could not be confirmed as malicious based on content alone. However, the use of urgency and authority warranted further technical analysis.
