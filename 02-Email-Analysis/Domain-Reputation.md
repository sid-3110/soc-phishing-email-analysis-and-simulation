Domain Reputation & Context Analysis
Objective

To assess the legitimacy of the sender domain using reputation and contextual indicators.
Domain Age & Registration

Observation:

    The domain used in the email was analyzed using WHOIS lookup and was found to be unregistered or non-existent.

SOC Interpretation: The use of a non-registered domain suggests domain spoofing or a look-alike domain that does not physically exist, which is a high-confidence indicator of a phishing attempt.
Reputation Check

The domain was checked against publicly available reputation sources.

Observation:

    No reputation signals were identified because the domain has no registration history.

SOC Interpretation: The lack of any registration or reputation history confirms the domain is not a legitimate corporate entity and likely serves as a temporary vehicle for malicious activity.
Contextual Analysis

    No prior communication history with the sender

    Generic sender naming

    Job-themed lure targeting urgency

Final SOC Assessment: The fact that the domain is unregistered, combined with weak authentication and contextual red flags, confirms this is a malicious communication. Immediate block/blacklist action is recommended.
